## 📧 EMAIL FLOW - WHAT WAS FIXED

### Before (Broken):
- ❌ Emails not sending
- ❌ Silent failures
- ❌ Inconsistent recipient handling
- ❌ Naming convention mismatches

### After (Working):
- ✅ Booking confirmation → Instant email
- ✅ Waitlist added → Position notification
- ✅ Waitlist promoted → Confirmation request
- ✅ Dual recipient handling (to + userEmail fallback)
- ✅ Both naming conventions supported
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging

---

## 🔄 BOOKING FLOW (PRODUCTION-READY)

### User Makes Booking:

```
1. User selects date + time slot
   ↓
2. API checks availability (Firestore transaction)
   ↓
3. CASE A: Slot Available
   → Status: confirmed
   → Email: booking_confirmation
   → Response: ✅ "Booking confirmed!"
   
4. CASE B: Slot Full
   → Status: waitlist
   → Add to waitlist with position
   → Email: bookingWaitlist
   → Response: 📋 "You're #3 on the waitlist"
```

### Waitlist Promotion:

```
1. Confirmed user cancels booking
   ↓
2. System finds next person in waitlist
   ↓
3. Update status → pending_confirmation
   ↓
4. Send email: waitlist_promoted
   ↓
5. User has 48 hours to confirm
   ↓
6. CASE A: User confirms
   → Status: confirmed
   → Email: booking_confirmation
   
7. CASE B: Deadline passes
   → Promote next person (repeat flow)
```
