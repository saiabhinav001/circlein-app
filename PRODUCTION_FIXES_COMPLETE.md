## 🚀 How Email System Works Now:

### Old System (NOT WORKING):
```
Contact Form → Firestore 'mail' collection → Firebase Extension → Email
                                              (Requires Blaze plan ❌)
```

### New System (WORKING):
```
Contact Form → /api/send-email → Nodemailer → Gmail SMTP → Email ✅
                                  (FREE forever)
```

### Email Routing:
- **Admin sends email** → Goes to: circleinapp1@gmail.com
- **Resident sends email** → Goes to: abhinav.sadineni@gmail.com
- **Sender**: circleinapp1@gmail.com (with beautiful HTML template)
