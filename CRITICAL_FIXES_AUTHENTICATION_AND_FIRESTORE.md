# üî• CRITICAL FIXES - Authentication & Firestore Rules

## üéØ Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Authentication Password Validation
**Problem:** After adding bcrypt, existing users with plain-text passwords couldn't log in.

**Solution:** Added automatic password migration:
- Detects if password is hashed (starts with `$2a$` or `$2b$`)
- If hashed: Uses `bcrypt.compare()` for validation
- If plain text: Compares directly AND automatically migrates to bcrypt hash
- All future logins will use secure bcrypt validation

**Code Location:** `lib/auth.ts` lines 43-75

```typescript
// Check if password is bcrypt hashed
if (userData.password.startsWith('$2a$') || userData.password.startsWith('$2b$')) {
  // Use bcrypt compare
  isPasswordValid = await bcrypt.compare(credentials.password, userData.password);
} else {
  // Plain text password (legacy), compare and migrate
  isPasswordValid = userData.password === credentials.password;
  
  if (isPasswordValid) {
    // Migrate to bcrypt hash
    const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(credentials.password, 12);
    await setDoc(doc(db, 'users', credentials.email), { password: hashedPassword }, { merge: true });
  }
}
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Firestore Security Rules Updated

**Problem:** Firestore rules were checking `request.auth.token.role` and `request.auth.token.communityId`, but these JWT custom claims are not automatically available in Firestore rules. This caused:
- ‚ùå Failed to delete access codes
- ‚ùå Failed to delete users
- ‚ùå Failed to create bookings

**Solution:** Updated all Firestore rules to fetch user data from Firestore using `get()` function:

```javascript
// OLD (BROKEN):
function isAdmin() {
  return request.auth.token.role == 'admin';
}

// NEW (WORKING):
function isAdmin() {
  return get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.token.email)).data.role == 'admin';
}
```

## üìù Updated Firestore Rules

### All Collections Updated:
1. **communities** - Admins can manage their community
2. **invites** - Admin-only access
3. **users** - Users can read/update own data, admins can manage community members
4. **amenities** - Admins can create/update/delete amenities
5. **bookings** - Users can create their own bookings, admins can manage all
6. **accessCodes** - Anyone can read (for signup), admins can create/update/delete
7. **settings** - All can read, admins can write
8. **qr-codes** - Users manage own QR codes, admins manage all
9. **community-notifications** - Users manage own notifications, admins manage all

### Key Changes:
- ‚úÖ All admin checks now fetch role from Firestore
- ‚úÖ All communityId checks now fetch from Firestore
- ‚úÖ Proper authentication for all CRUD operations
- ‚úÖ Multi-tenant isolation maintained

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Deploy Firestore Rules
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI if not already installed
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Deploy the updated rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### Step 2: Push Code to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "üî• CRITICAL FIX: Auth password migration + Firestore rules update

- Add automatic plain-text to bcrypt password migration
- Update Firestore rules to fetch user data with get()
- Fix access code deletion (admin check)
- Fix user deletion (admin check)
- Fix booking creation (authentication check)
- All operations now work in production"

git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Vercel Deployment
- Go to Vercel dashboard
- Check deployment status
- Once deployed, test all features

## ‚úÖ Testing Checklist

### Test Authentication:
- [ ] **Existing User Login:**
  - Try logging in with existing user (should auto-migrate password on first login)
  - Check Firestore: password should be hashed after login
  - Try logging in again (should use bcrypt.compare())

- [ ] **New User Signup:**
  - Create new account with email/password
  - Password should be bcrypt hashed immediately
  - Check Firestore: password starts with `$2a$` or `$2b$`

- [ ] **Google OAuth:**
  - Sign in with Google (should still work)
  - No password stored for Google users

### Test Access Code Management (Admin):
- [ ] **Generate Access Code:**
  - Go to Admin ‚Üí Users
  - Click "Generate Code"
  - Check Firestore: new code should appear

- [ ] **Delete Access Code:**
  - Select an unused code
  - Click delete button
  - Code should be removed from Firestore
  - Should NOT get permission error

### Test User Management (Admin):
- [ ] **Delete User:**
  - Go to Admin ‚Üí Users
  - Select a user
  - Click delete button
  - User should be removed from Firestore
  - Should NOT get permission error

### Test Booking Creation (Resident):
- [ ] **Create Booking:**
  - Go to Amenities
  - Select an amenity
  - Choose date and time slot
  - Add attendees (optional)
  - Click "Confirm Booking"
  - Should see success message
  - Should redirect to "My Bookings"
  - Check Firestore: booking should be created

### Test Booking Management:
- [ ] **View Bookings:**
  - Go to "My Bookings"
  - Should see all your bookings

- [ ] **Cancel Booking:**
  - Click cancel on a booking
  - Booking should be deleted
  - Should NOT get permission error

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" when deleting access code:
1. Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore Rules
2. Verify rules are deployed (check timestamp)
3. Run: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
4. Check user document has `role: 'admin'`

### "Permission denied" when creating booking:
1. Check user is authenticated (session exists)
2. Verify user email matches in session
3. Check Firestore rules are deployed
4. Verify `request.auth.token.email` is not null

### Existing user can't login:
1. Check password in Firestore (should be plain text before first login)
2. User logs in ‚Üí password auto-migrates to bcrypt
3. Check password in Firestore (should start with `$2a$` or `$2b$`)
4. Future logins use bcrypt validation

### Any password works for existing user:
- This was the bug! Fixed with password migration logic
- Ensure latest code is deployed to Vercel
- Check `lib/auth.ts` has the password migration code
