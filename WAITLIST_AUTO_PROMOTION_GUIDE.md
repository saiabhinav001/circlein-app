# üéØ Automatic Waitlist Promotion System - Complete Guide

## üîÑ Complete Flow

### Scenario: User A (Confirmed) ‚Üí User B (Waitlist #1) ‚Üí User C (Waitlist #2)

#### **Step 1: User A Cancels Booking**

1. User A clicks "Cancel" on their booking
2. System calls `/api/bookings/cancel/[id]`
3. Booking status changes: `confirmed` ‚Üí `cancelled`
4. User A receives cancellation email
5. System automatically searches for waitlist entries

#### **Step 2: User B Gets Promoted**

1. System finds User B (lowest waitlist position)
2. Status changes: `waitlist` ‚Üí `pending_confirmation`
3. Sets 48-hour confirmation deadline
4. **Email sent to User B with:**
   - ‚úÖ **YES, Confirm** button (green)
   - ‚ùå **NO, Decline** button (red)
   - Booking details
   - Countdown timer
   - Deadline warning

#### **Step 3A: User B Clicks YES**

1. Redirects to `/bookings/confirm/[id]?action=confirm`
2. Calls `/api/bookings/confirm/[id]` with `action: "confirm"`
3. Status changes: `pending_confirmation` ‚Üí `confirmed`
4. **Confirmation email sent with:**
   - QR code
   - Booking details
   - Calendar invite
5. ‚úÖ **DONE!** User B has the slot

#### **Step 3B: User B Clicks NO (or doesn't respond in 48h)**

1. If clicks NO: Redirects to `/bookings/confirm/[id]?action=decline`
2. Calls `/api/bookings/confirm/[id]` with `action: "decline"`
3. Status changes: `pending_confirmation` ‚Üí `declined`
4. System automatically calls `/api/bookings/promote-waitlist`
5. **User C gets promoted** (now in Step 2)
6. Email sent to User C with YES/NO buttons

- If no action within 48h:
  1. Status changes: `pending_confirmation` ‚Üí `expired`
  2. System calls `/api/bookings/promote-waitlist`
  3. Next person gets promoted
  4. Email sent to next person

**Cron job:** (Optional - can be implemented)
```typescript
// Check every hour for expired confirmations
// Path: /api/cron/check-expired-confirmations
// Find: status='pending_confirmation' AND confirmationDeadline < now
// Action: Mark expired, promote next
```
