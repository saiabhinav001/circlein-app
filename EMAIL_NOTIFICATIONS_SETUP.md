## üìß EMAIL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Email Service (`lib/email-service.ts`)
- **Templates**: 3 beautiful HTML templates
  1. `bookingConfirmation` - Instant booking emails
  2. `bookingReminder` - 1-hour before reminders
  3. `amenityBlocked` - Block notifications
- **Functions**:
  - `sendEmail()` - Send single email
  - `sendBatchEmails()` - Send to multiple residents (with rate limiting)

### API Endpoints

1. **`/api/notifications/email`** (POST)
   - Used by: Booking creation, reminder cron
   - Params: `type` (booking_confirmation | booking_reminder), `data`

2. **`/api/notifications/amenity-block`** (POST)
   - Used by: Admin blocking functions
   - Params: amenityName, reason, startDate, endDate, communityId, isFestive
   - Gets all resident emails from Firestore

3. **`/api/cron/booking-reminders`** (GET)
   - Automated by Vercel Cron
   - Runs every 10 minutes
   - Checks for bookings starting in ~1 hour
   - Sends reminders automatically

## üéØ HOW IT WORKS

  ‚Üì
Query bookings starting in ~1 hour
  ‚Üì

```

  ‚Üì
Fetch /api/notifications/amenity-block

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES
